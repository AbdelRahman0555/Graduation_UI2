        '''WHO emphasizes that a healthy, diverse diet is central to preventing and managing anaemia, especially iron-deficiency anaemia:

• Eat iron-rich foods such as lean meats, fish, poultry, legumes (lentils, beans), and dark green leafy vegetables.

• Boost iron absorption by eating foods rich in vitamin C (e.g., citrus fruits, peppers, fresh vegetables) alongside iron-rich foods.

• Avoid eating iron blockers at the same time as iron-rich foods — substances like tea, coffee, cocoa, and high-bran cereals can reduce iron absorption.

• Use food-based approaches that promote adequate intake of other important nutrients like folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin A, which are needed for healthy red blood cell production.''',
    'lifestyle': '''WHO highlights practical daily actions for anaemia prevention:

• Follow food hygiene and infection prevention practices (e.g., handwashing with soap and clean water) to reduce infections that can contribute to anaemia.

• Follow local malaria prevention guidance in malaria-endemic areas to reduce one major cause of anaemia.''',

• Supports maintaining a healthy body weight key to diabetes prevention.

• Includes nutritious whole foods and avoids excessive sugars and saturated fats (e.g., sugary drinks, sweets, processed snacks).

• Basic WHO healthy-diet principles (applied to diabetes) include eating plenty of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting free sugars and salt.''',
    'lifestyle': '''WHO recommends:

• At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity (such as brisk walking, swimming, cycling).

• Staying physically active helps improve glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity, and overall cardiovascular health.

• Keeping a healthy body weight lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or helps improve control if diabetes is present.

• Avoiding tobacco use benefits overall health and reduces the risk of complications associated with diabetes.''',
